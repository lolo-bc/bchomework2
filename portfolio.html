Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me but experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo or when in doubt, wash eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner. Cry louder at reflection sit by the fire chase mice.
